# 3D-Reconstruction
3D Reconstruction via Stereo Vision and Triangulation uses multiple cameras to capture images from different angles, calculating depth from image disparities to build a 3D model. Volumetric Techniques reconstruct 3D objects by dividing the space into volume elements. Both methods create detailed 3D models from 2D images.
